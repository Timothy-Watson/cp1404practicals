# CP1404 Practicals

## Timothy Watson

My practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

Lessons I've learnt about clean code:

- Use clear and concise names
- There is usually more than 1 way to code a problem, but there is usually a best way to do it
- Docstrings and commenting is a useful way to help future you and anyone else understand the code
