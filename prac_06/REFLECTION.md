## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I made sure that I get the practicals done as soon in the week so that I don't cram it last minute.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I still get distracted very easily. I need to focus on staying on 1 task at a time as I get work done, I just love to switch what I'm doing which makes me inefficient.

I have made sure to keep going back to the programming patterns page and make sure that I consistently use the correct pattern in my programs.

I'm not too sure. I need to be more careful with my submissions as I have small mistakes that gets marks taken off. So I need to be more thorough and make sure I review my work before I submit it.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I personally don't have any requests or changes for the subject so far. I am enjoying the degree and I hope to continue that.
