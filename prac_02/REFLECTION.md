100%

I scheduled all day Saturday and Sunday to watch the lecture videos in my office.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am happy that I have watched all the lecture videos and understood them well. It is easy to stop concentrating on what I am doing, but I am doing an alright job at stayinbg on task.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to complete all of my work for the week earlier as I tend to cram all of it on the last few days. NOT GOOD.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I wouldn't say I am doing anything poorly in particular, but I just need to be mindful that I use the most efficient way to do things.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I think I am doing them all well. I am most happy that I am getting the practicals submitted on time.
