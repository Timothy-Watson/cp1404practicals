# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Sometimes I would get a pretty accurate time on some of the smaller projects.
On some of the larger projects, I would underestimate the time by about half as much as it actually took.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I think they somewhat improved over time,
but I wasn't the most accurate at predicting the time of a project even over the duration of the subject.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learnt to look at the whole problem before I even started the project.
This helped me fully understand what was needed to be done as I was able to get the full picture
then I could break it into its smaller, more manageable parts.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

It was nice seeing the small details that I missed out on.
As I mostly missed out on making some aspects of my code into functions.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

When I did code reviews, I compared it to my own code to see where both, my and their code could improve.
This helped me also see how other people completed the task and make me reconsider my approach to it
which helped understand where I could improve in my own code and what ather methods there is to get the same outcome.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Good Code Review 1](https://github.com/William-Bowman-JCU/cp1404practicals/pull/4#pullrequestreview-2441044834)

### Explanation

I went through all the code and noticed some small aspects that could be improved.

### Good Code Review 2

[Good Code Review 2](https://github.com/KennethNjeri/cp1404practicals/pull/3#event-15196682145)

### Explanation

Everything was good with the code. I just noticed a lack of docstrings which I commented on.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I wouldn't really change anything. I enjoy the way things are laid out and the tasks are easy to understand and complete.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I am very happy that I was able to complete all the practicals before the due date.
I am usually really bad at putting off anything until last minute, so I am very proud of myself for that.
